#' Process concentration measurements into values by category
#'
#' @description This function aggregates the concentration values of individual
#'    substances into sums by chemical category. The act of defining the
#'    aggregated values takes place in the \code{summarise_censoring} function.
#'    In addition, this function drops the chemicals, for which the values are
#'    too uninformative.
#' @param dat A data frame containing concentration measurements with metadata
#'    columns `Park`, `Sample_number`, `Species`, `Sex`, `Age` and
#'    `Date_of_sample_collection`
#' @param chem_categories A data frame with columns `Chemical`,
#'    `primary_category`, and `Quantification_threshold`
#' @param exclude_uninformative A logical flag, indicating whether to drop
#'    uninformative substances from the list of measured chemicals. We want
#'    to exclude them from the model fitting, but keep them for the descriptive
#'    plots. See ‘Details’.
#' @return A data frame with aggregated measurements by category including
#'    detection status and interval bounds for best/worst-case
#'    scenarios
#' @details If \code{exclude_uninformative = TRUE}, all chemicals are dropped
#'    from the analysis, for which:
#'    \begin{itemize}
#'      \item no "quantified" value was found and at the same time
#'      \item the proportion of the "detected" values is less than 5 %
#'    \end{itemize}
#'
#'    Overall detection status:
#'    \begin{itemize}
#'      \item "quantified": At least one sample in a category contains a
#'      quantified value.
#'      \item "detected": No sample contains a quantified value and at least one
#'      sample in a category contains a detected value under the quantification
#'      limit.
#'      \item "not detected": All samples are non-detects.
#'    \end{itemize}
#'    Definition of the best/worst-cases:
#'    \begin{itemize}
#'      \item For all samples containing only non-detects or non-quantifiable
#'      values, the best case is a (near) 0 value and the worst case is the sum
#'      of the detection thresholds.
#'      \item When at least value is quantified, the non-detects and
#'      non-quantifiable ones are resolved as above and then the sum of all
#'      quantifiable values is added to the both best and worst case values.
#'    \end{itemize}
